# Luzifer / habitscheduler

Currently I'm using [HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com/) for my task management. They are able to manage daily repeating tasks but not tasks recurring using a cron-like scheme or tasks recurring every 6 weeks after their last completion. To handle those tasks this project has been created.

The habitscheduler is a web application providing an API to schedule tasks with cron-like scheme or recurrance expressed in hours after last completion.
